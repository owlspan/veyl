# frontend - the shared front end

The lexer, parser, AST and type representation. Everything up to but not
including a decision about what to emit.

Both backends import this. `../src` compiles Veyl to Go, `../asm-src`
compiles it to x86-64 assembly, and they read the same definition of
what the language *is* rather than two copies that drift apart.

```
frontend/          token, lexer, ast, types, parser
  |
  +--> src/        -> Go source -> go build -> .exe
  +--> asm-src/    -> x86-64 asm -> as, ld  -> .exe
```

## Why it could be lifted out unchanged

None of these files ever knew which backend they fed. Moving them took
three changes:

- `pos` became `Span`, with exported fields, because the type checker
  constructs one `Widen` node and now does so from another package.
- `qual`, `keywords`, `isAlpha`, `isDigit` and `isHexDigit` were
  exported, because the formatter and the editor generator use them.
- Nothing else. Every AST node type and field was already exported.

## How the backends use it

Each backend has a `frontend.go` holding Go type aliases:

```go
type Expr = front.Expr
const PLUS = front.PLUS
```

Aliases, not new types, which is why every other file in those packages
still writes `Expr` and `PLUS` unqualified. Adding a name to the front
end means adding one line to each alias file and changing nothing else.

Regenerate them after adding an exported name; the alias files are
sorted and mechanical.

## Testing

```
go test ./...
```

`lexer_test.go` and `types_test.go` live here, with the code they test.
The backends test their own halves: `../src` runs a golden-file suite,
and `../asm-src` compares its output against `../src` byte for byte.
