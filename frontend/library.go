// The seam between the type checker and a backend's set of builtins.
//
// The checker is shared; the builtins are not. The Go backend offers 302
// of them, backed by Go's standard library. The assembly backend offers
// far fewer, because everything it has it had to write. Neither list
// belongs in the checker, and the checker should not have to care which
// one it is looking at.
//
// So a backend hands the checker a Library, and the checker asks it
// questions. That is the whole interface. What it buys, beyond letting
// check.go be shared at all:
//
//   - A builtin a backend does not have becomes an ordinary compile
//     error with a position and a suggestion, rather than something
//     discovered further down the pipeline in a different vocabulary.
//   - The two backends cannot drift on what a builtin's signature is,
//     because the signature is declared in one shape.

// A Signature is everything the checker needs to know about a builtin.
// Deliberately not the whole builtin: how one is emitted, which imports
// it drags in and which runtime helpers it needs are the backend's
// business and never the checker's.

	Ret *Type
	// RetOf overrides Ret for polymorphic builtins - min and max return
	// whatever type they were given.
	RetOf func(args []*Type) *Type

	// Check replaces the Params/Rest/Ret machinery for builtins whose
	// rules cannot be written as a fixed signature. It reports its own
	// errors and returns the result type.
	Check func(c *Checker, x *Call, args []*Type) *Type

	// HintFor supplies the expected type of argument i given the ones
	// before it, so an empty literal passed to a polymorphic builtin has
	// something to infer from. Return nil to leave an argument unhinted.
