// The garbage collector.
//
// Mark and sweep, with conservative roots and precise tracing. That
// split is what this backend's shape makes possible, and it is worth
// saying why each half is the way it is.
//
// **Roots are conservative** because there is no stack map. A frame here
// is a block of slots and nothing records which of them hold pointers at
// a given instruction. So the stack is read as a flat array of words and
// any word that is the address of a known object is treated as a root.
// The cost is that an integer that happens to equal an object's address
// keeps it alive; the benefit is that no other part of the compiler has
// to be told about collection.
//
// What makes that sound here rather than hopeful: **every pointer lives
// in a stack slot.** The register allocator in regalloc.go only ever
// takes values that are not pointers, so there is no such thing as a
// pointer that exists only in a machine register and would be missed.
// That restriction is load-bearing: TestRegAllocKeepsPointersSlotted is
// there so it cannot be relaxed by accident.
//
// **Tracing is precise** because every object carries a header saying
// what it is: raw bytes, pointer-free words, all-pointer words, a list
// header, a map header, or a struct with a count of leading pointers.
// That header went in long before there was a collector, for exactly
// this moment.
//
// Nothing collects automatically. `mem.collect()` is the only thing that
// runs it. Automatic collection would need to be sure that no allocation
// site has a live pointer sitting in a register between the allocation
// and the store that parks it - which is true of every site written so
// far, but is a property nobody is currently checking, and a collector
// that frees one live object produces a bug hours away from its cause.
