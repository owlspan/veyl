//	runtime error: index 5 is out of range for a list of length 3
//	    at game.vl:42 in update
//
// The first line is the Go backend's, byte for byte, as it always was.
// The second is new, and costs nothing until something fails: each
// place that can fail - an index checked against its length, a must, an
// abort - knows at compile time which statement it is in, so it is
// handed that statement's file, line and function as a string constant,
// written to a runtime word just before the error routine is called.
// Nothing is stored as the program runs normally, so a loop pays
// nothing for it, and a call made earlier in the same statement cannot
// leave a stale answer behind.
//
// Crashes that are not Veyl's runtime errors - an access violation from
// a bad address given to mem.*, a native function misbehaving - are
// caught by crash.go instead, which names the function they happened
// in.
